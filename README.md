# Cryptocurrency Clusters
For this assignment we are tasked to review if the cryptocurrencies can be grouped to create a classification system for an investment bankâ€™s new investment. The bank is new to the cryptocurrencies market and would like to have more insight on the market. 

### Using the t-SNE Model
There does not appear to be distinct clusters. There are about three separate dots that float separately from the main cluster which appears to be more like outliers than another cluster.

### Cluster Analysis with k-Means
Based on the k-Means model, a clear elbow could not be formed. If a clear elbow cannot be plotted then the number of clusters cannot be found.

### Conclusions
Both the t-SNE Model and k-means could not identify clusters in their plots. Based on those results it can be concluded that cryptocurrencies could not be clustered together.
